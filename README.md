## Running tests

Tests are not actual unit tests, they are just files with separate main functions used to test each part of the application. Tests are not guaranteed to work, you will probably need to change something in the test files to make them work for you.

To see the list of all available tests run

```bash
make test.ls
```

To compile and run one of the given tests type

```bash
make tets.run.test_name
```
